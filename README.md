Task 1: arrayManipulation.js
This file contains two functions:
- processArray(arr): This function takes an array of numbers and processes each element based on whether it's even or odd. Even numbers are squared, and odd numbers are multiplied by 3.
- formatArrayStrings(strArr, numArr): This function takes two arrays - one containing strings and the other containing numbers. It formats the strings based on whether the corresponding number in the numArr is even or odd. Even numbers result in uppercase strings, and odd numbers result in lowercase strings.

Task 2: userInfo.js
This file contains a function createUserProfiles(names, modifiedNames) that creates user profiles based on the input arrays of names and modified names. Each profile object contains the original name, modified name, and an auto-incremented ID starting from 1.
